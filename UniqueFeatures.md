# Unique Features
## C#
LINQ is a heavy unique feature that C# implemented initially. Interoperability of any language written in a .NET compliancy also enables it to access classes and libraries from code in other languages. The namespace feature of C# enables classes to be accessed independent of their directory. It uses Microsoftâ€™s Dynamic-Link Library system to provide a single universal copy of a library, instead of necessitating multiple copies in every project directory. Another unique feature of C# is its operator overloading, which allows the developer to add additional functionality to basic operators in the language.

## Python
The importance of indentation and significant whitespace was unique to python, and assisted in enforcing readability in developers code. Python also includes Generator expressions, which are a different version of list expressions, and enable the run-time generation of iterable structures without consuming as much data.
